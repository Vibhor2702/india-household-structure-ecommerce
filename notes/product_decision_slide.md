| **Competitor replication** | High | Low | Speed to market; build ops moat (inventory algorithms) |

### 🎤 **One-Slide Summary**

> **"We're shifting from a one-size-fits-all model to a household-driven strategy. By customizing our offering for single/small vs family households at the neighborhood level, we can increase conversion by 25% and basket size by 15% while reducing CAC by 25%.
