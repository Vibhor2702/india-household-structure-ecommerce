## 💡 Key Talking Points to Memorize

### The Core Insight
"Household composition creates predictable demand patterns. Bachelor-heavy neighborhoods show 20-35% higher conversion and favor different categories than family-heavy areas."

### The Business Impact
"This analysis enables three high-value decisions: market sequencing (saves ₹15-20 Cr), merchandising strategy (15% basket increase), and product prioritization (25% conversion lift)."

### The Strategic Shift
"Most quick-commerce companies expand uniformly. I'd shift to micro-market targeting—win bachelor neighborhoods first with differentiated offering, then scale to families."

### The Execution Plan
"Launch 'Quick Singles' pilot in 5 neighborhoods (60 days), geo-segment inventory by pin code (90 days), and halt expansion in low-internet states (immediate)."

### The Critical Thinking
"This uses household size as a proxy, which is imperfect. I'd validate with a small pilot before major capital commitment—data informs where to test, not what will definitely work."
