**Which Charts to Show in Interviews & Reviews**

---

## For Quick Skimming (Show These 3)

### 1. [India Adoption Map](../visualizations/india_map.html) 
**Purpose:** Market prioritization  
**Key Insight:** Geographic clustering of high-adoption states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Haryana)  
**Use Case:** "Which states should we expand to first?"  
**Interview Talking Points:**
- Top 8 states show 2-3x higher adoption vs. bottom 10
- Clear north-south divide suggests infrastructure/demographic patterns
- Validates phased expansion (tier-1 aggressive → tier-2 selective → tier-3 watch)

**What Makes It Strong:**
- Intuitive (heat map is universal language)
- Actionable (directly informs expansion strategy)
- Shows data-driven decision-making

---

### 2. [Household Size vs. Adoption Curve](../visualizations/hh_size_adoption.html)
**Purpose:** Segmentation rationale  
**Key Insight:** Negative correlation (r=-0.196, p<0.0001) — each additional household member reduces odds by 31%  
**Use Case:** "Why should we target bachelor neighborhoods?"  
**Interview Talking Points:**
- Clear downward trend (not just noise)
- Statistical significance (p<0.0001) builds confidence
- Directly informs micro-market targeting strategy

**What Makes It Strong:**
- Simple visual (anyone can understand trend line)
- Quantified relationship (31% odds reduction)
- Supports differentiated strategy vs. one-size-fits-all

---

### 3. [Category Skew Analysis](../visualizations/category_skew.html)
**Purpose:** Merchandising strategy  
**Key Insight:** Singles over-index 1.43x on food, 1.31x on medicine, 1.30x on electronics  
**Use Case:** "How should inventory differ by neighborhood?"  
**Interview Talking Points:**
- Directional clarity (singles prefer convenience, families prefer bulk)
- Quantified skew (1.43x means 43% higher propensity)
- Enables geo-segmented inventory strategy

**What Makes It Strong:**
- Actionable (tells merchandising exactly what to do)
- Trade-off clarity (over-index singles = under-index families)
- Supports profit margin strategy (premium pricing on convenience)

---

## For Deep Dive (If Asked)

### 4. [Category Comparison Dashboard](../visualizations/category_comparison.html)
**Purpose:** Category-level detail  
**When to Use:** If interviewer asks "Which specific categories should we prioritize?"  
**Key Insight:** Food delivery has highest single-household skew (1.43x) + large TAM  
**Talking Points:**
- Food = best combination of skew + volume
- Medicine = highest loyalty but smaller TAM
- Electronics = high margin but lower frequency

---

### 5. [Executive Summary Dashboard](../visualizations/executive_summary.html)
**Purpose:** One-page overview  
**When to Use:** If time-constrained or presenting to senior leadership  
**Key Insight:** All findings in one view  
**Talking Points:**
- Designed for 5-minute skim
- Combines geography + segmentation + merchandising
- Useful for pre-reads or post-meeting follow-ups

## How to Present Each Chart (Interview Tips)

### Chart 1: India Map

**❌ Wrong Way:**
"This map shows online purchase penetration by state..."

**✅ Right Way:**
"If I had ₹100 Cr to expand, I wouldn't spread it evenly. This map shows Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have 2-3x higher adoption. I'd concentrate capital there first, then selectively pilot in tier-2 states with similar patterns. The bottom 10 states? I'd wait until internet infrastructure catches up—otherwise we're burning cash."

**Why it works:** Starts with the decision, uses data to support, acknowledges trade-offs.

---

### Chart 2: Household Size Curve

**❌ Wrong Way:**
"There's a negative correlation between household size and adoption, with r=-0.196..."

**✅ Right Way:**
"Not all neighborhoods are equal. This chart shows 1-2 person households buy 20-35% more online than larger families. That means a dark store near an IT park or university will naturally convert better than one in a residential area. So instead of opening stores uniformly, I'd target bachelor-heavy neighborhoods first—higher ROI, faster payback."

**Why it works:** Translates correlation into product action, explains "so what?"

---

### Chart 3: Category Skew

**❌ Wrong Way:**
"Singles over-index 1.43x on food and 1.31x on medicine..."

**✅ Right Way:**
"If we stock the same SKUs everywhere, we're leaving money on the table. Singles want ready-to-eat meals and single-serve packs—they over-index 1.4x on food. Families want bulk packs. So I'd customize inventory by pin code: bachelor areas get more convenience SKUs, family areas get more bulk. Expected impact: 15% basket size increase + fewer stockouts."

**Why it works:** Identifies the problem (one-size-fits-all), uses data to support solution, quantifies impact.

## Common Interview Questions & How to Use Visuals

### Q: "How would you prioritize which markets to enter?"

**Answer Structure:**
1. Show Chart 1 (India Map)
2. Explain 3-tier framework (aggressive/selective/watch)
3. Tie to business impact (40-50% lower burn rate)

**Key Point:** "Data helps us avoid low-ROI markets, but we still need to validate with pilots."

---

### Q: "How would you differentiate from competitors?"

**Answer Structure:**
1. Show Chart 2 (HH Size Curve)
2. Explain micro-market targeting (bachelor neighborhoods)
3. Show Chart 3 (Category Skew) to explain merchandising differentiation

**Key Point:** "Most competitors expand uniformly. We'd win bachelor neighborhoods first with better assortment—higher margins, faster repeat."

---

### Q: "What assumptions are you making? How confident are you?"

**Answer Structure:**
1. Acknowledge proxy (household size ≠ exact demographics)
2. Explain correlation vs. causation
3. Emphasize "this tells us where to test, not what will definitely work"
4. Discuss validation plan (pilot → measure → scale or kill)

**Key Point:** "I'm confident in the pattern, but would validate with a small pilot before major capital commitment."

---

### Q: "What would you build in the first 90 days?"

**Answer Structure:**
1. Decision 1: Halt low-ROI expansions (saves capital)
2. Decision 2: Launch "Quick Singles" pilot (shows Chart 3 to explain merchandising)
3. Decision 3: Geo-segment inventory (shows Chart 2 to explain targeting)

**Key Point:** "All three decisions reinforce each other—better targeting, better assortment, better economics."

## What NOT to Do with These Charts

### ❌ Don't: Read off the chart
**Why:** Interviewer can read. Your job is to interpret and recommend.

### ❌ Don't: Over-explain methodology
**Why:** Focus on insights, not how you calculated correlation coefficients.

### ❌ Don't: Claim certainty
**Why:** Product decisions involve uncertainty. Show you understand limitations.

### ❌ Don't: Show all 5 charts unless asked
**Why:** Less is more. Start with 2-3 most important, go deeper if prompted.

### ❌ Don't: Forget to connect to business metrics
**Why:** Charts without impact = academic exercise.

## Chart Quality Checklist

For each chart, ask:

1. **Is it easy to understand in <10 seconds?**  
   ✅ India map, HH size curve, category skew (all visual)  
   ⚠️ Executive dashboard (needs explanation)

2. **Does it answer a specific product question?**  
   ✅ All charts directly inform decisions

3. **Can I explain the "so what?" without reading the chart?**  
   ✅ Yes—each chart has clear product implication

4. **Would a non-technical person understand it?**  
   ✅ Yes—all charts use intuitive visuals (maps, trend lines, bar charts)

5. **Does it support a specific recommendation?**  
   ✅ Map → expansion strategy, Curve → targeting, Skew → merchandising

## Final Tips

1. **Start with the decision, not the data**  
   Bad: "This chart shows..."  
   Good: "If I were expanding, I'd..."

2. **Use specific numbers, but don't drown in them**  
   Bad: "r=-0.196, p=0.000012, with 95% confidence interval..."  
   Good: "Singles show 20-35% higher adoption, statistically significant"

3. **Always mention trade-offs**  
   "Bachelor neighborhoods convert better, but family households have larger basket sizes in other categories—so we need different strategies for each"

4. **Connect to metrics that matter**  
   Conversion, CAC, LTV, basket size, repeat rate—not just correlation coefficients

5. **Show you know limitations**  
   "This uses household size as a proxy, which is imperfect. I'd validate with order data before major capital commitment."

**Remember:** These charts are tools to support your thinking, not the thinking itself. The insight is in your interpretation and recommendations, not in the visuals.
